Aka frontend for backenders


Google the following: "best frontend themes"
and "best static site generator"

Also, there is a "devil in the details": if the photo is *just* not right, or the placement is *just* off, it looks terrible. The cost function is highly discontinuous, which in my opinion is less so often in backend development. To make concrete: with backend stuff, you'll generally have a target, and stuff you write will generally begin to approach that target. There are less surprisals. With frontend stuff, there is a nebulous idea of "make it look attractive and appealing", which is hard to a) reach/understand and b) not quite apparent how moving an element by one pixel will affect the loss function. 

Further: an entire class of frontend sites can generally be decomposed into single page, "bootstrap" esque things. But the execution of such a site REALLY matters!
